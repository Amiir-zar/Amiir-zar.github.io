                        <br />
                        One of the essential aspects of successful agriculture is proper irrigation planning. One of the
                        key elements in
                        irrigation planning is measuring or monitoring soil moisture. Various devices, such as
                        tensometers, gypsum blocks, and
                        other soil moisture measuring tools, can be used to measure soil moisture. However, the results
                        of recent research
                        suggest that the combination of the sensors can reduce agricultural water consumptions greately.

                    <div class="image main"><img src="/images/Irrigation/irrigation_image.jpg" alt="" /></div>

                    <br />
                    This project was initiated with the aim of developing a new type of sensor that could improve the
                    performance of
                    existing soil moisture measuring devices. The proposed sensor would be a combination of gypsum
                    blocks and YL-69 sensors,
                    which would allow for more accurate and reliable measurements of soil moisture content. By
                    compounding these two
                    sensors, the project team sought to leverage the strengths of both technologies, with gypsum blocks
                    providing a porous
                    material to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment and YL-69 sensors converting the
                    changes in moisture levels
                    into electrical signals that can be read and analyzed.
                    <br /><br />
                    The need for such a sensor arises from the fact that accurate measurements of soil moisture are
                    crucial for efficient
                    irrigation planning, which is essential for sustainable agriculture. However, many existing soil
                    moisture measuring
                    devices suffer from limitations such as poor accuracy, limited range, and high cost. Therefore,
                    there is a need for new
                    sensors that can provide more precise and reliable data at a lower cost.
                    To achieve the project's goal, the team had to conduct various experiments to test the performance
                    of the newly
                    developed sensor. Initially, they designed and created a prototype sensor using a 3D printer, but
                    the results were not
                    as desired. They then redesigned the sensor, taking into account factors such as maintaining the
                    structure, durability,
                    and efficient use of space to allow the plaster to reach all parts of the circuit. After
                    manufacturing the plaster
                    blocks, the team conducted tests to check the accuracy of the measurements, which were found to be
                    satisfactory.
                    <br /><br />
                    In conclusion, this project was aimed at developing a new sensor by compounding gypsum blocks and
                    YL-69 sensors to
                    enhance their performance. By leveraging the strengths of these two sensors, the project team sought
                    to address the
                    limitations of existing soil moisture measuring devices and provide more accurate and reliable data
                    for efficient
                    irrigation planning. Through various experiments and tests, the team was able to successfully
                    develop a new sensor that
                    can provide more precise and reliable data at a lower cost.
                    <br />
                    <div class="image main"><img src="/images/Irrigation/Arduino_irrigation.jpg" alt="" /></div>



                    The team recognized that collecting data from the sensors was only the first step in optimizing
                    irrigation efficiency.
                    They needed to be able to use this data to control irrigation in real-time and make decisions based
                    on the data
                    collected.

                    To achieve this goal, the team developed a server and application for users to access and control
                    their irrigation
                    system. The server would collect data from the sensors and send it to the user's application, which
                    they could access
                    from their smartphone or computer. The user could then use this data to make informed decisions
                    about when and how much
                    to irrigate their crops.

                    The application had several features, including real-time updates of soil moisture levels, alerts
                    when soil moisture
                    levels fell below a certain threshold, and the ability to adjust irrigation settings remotely. With
                    these features,
                    farmers could monitor and control their irrigation system from anywhere, at any time, maximizing
                    efficiency and
                    minimizing water waste.

                    Overall, the second phase of the project focused on creating an end-to-end solution that could
                    automate the entire
                    irrigation process. By combining the sensors with a user-friendly application, farmers could achieve
                    optimal irrigation
                    efficiency, saving water and improving crop yields.

                    <br />
                    The project started by designing and manufacturing the gypsum block sensor, which includes two
                    concentric cylindrical
                    conductor axes as the cathode in the center of the system and plaster filling the surrounding
                    area. The gypsum block
                    sensor was then tested to determine its accuracy. Next, the YL-69 moisture sensor was connected
                    to an Arduino processor
                    to measure soil moisture levels. The project team wrote code to process the numbers read by the
                    YL-69 sensor and
                    establish a relationship between voltage and soil moisture. Ten sensors were defined, and their
                    output values were
                    correlated with humidity levels. A calibration coefficient of 1 was initially used. A threshold
                    value was also specified
                    to determine the irrigation period. If the percentage of moisture was less than that value, a
                    red light turned on, and
                    the message "needs watering" appeared. Otherwise, a green light turned on, and the message "no
                    need to water" appeared.

                    <div class="image main"><img src="/images/Irrigation/system.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                    <br />
                    The project resulted in the successful creation of a new sensor by compounding gypsum blocks and
                    YL-69 sensors, which
                    enhanced their performance. The team was able to automate the irrigation process using these
                    sensors and the data they
                    provided by creating a server and application for users. By measuring soil moisture accurately,
                    the project aimed to
                    reduce agricultural water consumption and increase crop yields. The project team conducted tests
                    using manufactured
                    plaster blocks and found the accuracy of their measurements to be satisfactory, with a result of
                    nearly 92%. The Aruino
                    was used for the analysis without using the YL-69 device, and it was successful. Overall, the
                    project provided a
                    practical solution for farmers to monitor soil moisture levels and make informed decisions about
                    irrigation, leading to
                    increased crop yields and reduced water consumption.
